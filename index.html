        <h2>About Dax</h2>
        <article>
          <p>
            Dax, or Daniel Nwosu Jr., is a rap artist, singer, and songwriter
            from Canada. Dax, also often stylized in all caps as DAX, was born
            March 22, 1994. In his early life, Dax moved from Ottawa to Wichita,
            Kansas to attend college, before ending up in Los Angeles,
            California as a student at Newman University. During his time at
            Newman, he played guard for the Newman Jets -- a collegiate
            basketball team, and kicked off his rap career while working as a
            janitor for the university.

          <h3>The Rise of Dax</h3>
          <p>
            In 2016, during a bus ride alongside his basketball team, Dax was
            working on writing poetry; his friends were quite impressed by his
            ability. Leveraging popular music app "SoundCloud" as a way to
            broadcast his music, he began turning his poetry into songs. His
            initial rise to fame can be attributed to the official music video
            produced for his song 'Catch Me Outside', featuring Danielle
            Bregoli. Later, Dax would release his first extended play, 'It's
            Different Now', in August 2018, which was supported by guests such
            as OT Genasis and Futuristic.
